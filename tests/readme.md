# Stresstest

This little set of bash scripts i use for stresstesting my esp8266 ledstrip controller.
I had some nasty memory leaks and heap fragmentation errors driving me nuts, after all, I really don't know how to program arduino :)

Those errors are fixed but i'll leave the "testsuite" in here for later purposes in case i did use too many strings and things go beserk after adding more functionality.

This setup requires a working mqtt setup including the mosquito client tools on the local machine.
